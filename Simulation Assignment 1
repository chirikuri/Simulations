Problem Statement: The initial co-ordinate of a fighter plane is given which is
                   supposed to hit a bombing site. The bombing site is moving
                   and its co-ordinates at 1 second interval are given. If the
                   velocity of the bomb is 20 kmph and it is always directed
                   towards the bombing site, determine whether the bomb
                   will hit the bombing site successfully or not.
Note: The bomb would be said to successfully hit the target if it is within
      10km proximity of the target at point of time.
